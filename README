CYBV311 Introduction to Security Programming II - Assembly Language

This git repository is a learning resource for the CYBV311 Introduction to Security Programming II course.  

The assembly files contained in this project are written for the NASM assembler.  The assembler is available on multiple 
platforms and can be downloaded here:

  https://www.nasm.us/pub/nasm/releasebuilds/?C=M;O=D  

The project files uploaded to this repository were created using Visual Studio 2019 Community Edition.  In order to
use the NASM assembler with the Visual Studio projects you will need to setup a custom build configuration to 
allow for the ASM files to be compiled with NASM and linked with the Visual Studio linker.  One good way to accomplish
this is to download and use VSNASM, which can be found here:

  https://github.com/ShiftMediaProject/VSNASM
  
There are instructions in the VSNASM README for installing using a batch file or installing manually.  

Be sure to add NASM.exe to the "Build Customization Search Path".  This path is used to find the executable programs
used when a custom build is invoked.  The setting in Visual Studio 2019 can be found under:
  
  Tools->Options then Projects and Solutions->VC++ Project Settings
  
My path looks like this:

  "c:\program files\NASM"

This is the default installation location for NASM on Windows.
